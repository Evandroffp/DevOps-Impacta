Core Enhancements
Run-time Loadable MPMsMultiple MPMs can now be built as loadable modules at compile time. The MPM of choice can be configured at run time
via LoadModule directive.Event MPMThe Event MPM is no longer experimental but is now fully supported.Asynchronous supportBetter support for asynchronous read/write for supporting MPMs and platforms.Per-module and per-directory LogLevel configurationThe LogLevel can now be configured per module and per directory. New levels trace1 to trace8 have been added above the debug log level.Per-request configuration sections<If>, <ElseIf>, and <Else> sections can be used to set the configuration based on per-request criteria.General-purpose expression parserA new expression parser allows to specify complex conditions using a common syntax in directives like SetEnvIfExpr, RewriteCond, Header, <If>, and others.KeepAliveTimeout in millisecondsIt is now possible to specify KeepAliveTimeout in milliseconds.NameVirtualHost directiveNo longer needed and is now deprecated.Override ConfigurationThe new AllowOverrideList directive allows more fine grained control which directives are allowed in .htaccess files.Config file variablesIt is now possible to Define variables in the configuration, allowing a clearer representation if the same value is used at many places in the configuration.Reduced memory usageDespite many new features, 2.4.x tends to use less memory than 2.2.x.topNew Modules
mod_proxy_fcgiFastCGI Protocol backend for mod_proxymod_proxy_scgiSCGI Protocol backend for mod_proxymod_proxy_expressProvides dynamical
ly configured mass reverse proxies for mod_proxymod_remoteipReplaces the apparent client remote IP address and hostname for the request
with the IP address list presented by a proxies or a load balancer via the request headers.mod_heartmonitor, mod_lbmethod_heartbeatAllo
w mod_proxy_balancer to base loadbalancing decisions on the number of active connections on the backend servers.mod_proxy_htmlFormerly a third-party module, this supports fixing of HTML links in a reverse proxy situation, where the backend generates URLs that are not valid for the proxy's clients.mod_sedAn advanced replacement of mod_substitute, allows to edit the response body with the full power of sed.mod_auth_formEnables form-based authentication.mod_sessionEnables the use of session state for clients, using cookie or database storage.mod_allowmethodsNew module to restrict certain HTTP methods without interfering with authentication or authorization.mod_luaEmbeds the Lua language into httpd, for configuration and small business logic functions. (Experimental)mod_log_debugAllows the addition of customizable debug logging at different phases of the request processing.mod_bufferProvides for buffering the input and output filter stacksmod_dataConvert response body into an RFC2397 data URLmod_ratelimitProvides Bandwidth Rate Limiting for Clientsmod_requestProvides Filters to handle and make available HTTP request bodiesmod_reflectorProvides Reflection of a request body as a response via the output filter stack.mod_slotmem_shmProvides a Slot-based shared memory provider (ala the scoreboard).mod_xml2encFormerly a third-party module, this supports internationalisation in libxml2-based (markup-aware) filter modules.mod_macro (available since 2.4.5)Provide macros within configuration files.mod_proxy_wstunnel (available since 2.4.5)Support web-socket tunnels.mod_authnz_fcgi (available since 2.4.10)Enable FastCGI authorizer applications to authenticate and/or authorize clients.mod_http2 (available since 2.4.17)Support for the HTTP/2 transport layer.mod_proxy_hcheck (available since 2.4.21)Support independent dynamic health checks for remote proxiy backend servers.topModule Enhancements
mod_sslmod_ssl can now be configured to use an OCSP server to check the validation status of a client certificate. The default respond


er is configurable, along with the decision on whether to prefer the responder designated in the client certificate itself.mod_ssl now al
so suppo

rts OCSP stapling, where the server pro-actively obtains an OCSP verification of its certificate and transmits that to the client during 
the handshake.mod_ssl can now be configured to share SSL Session data between servers through memcachedEC keys are now supported in addition to 
RSA and DSA.Support for TLS-SRP (available in 2.4.4 and later).mod_proxyThe ProxyPass directive is now most optimally configured within 
a Location or LocationMatch block, and offers a significant performance advantage over the traditional two-parameter syntax when present


in large numbers.The source address used for proxy requests is now configurable.Support for Unix domain sockets to the backend (available in 7 and later).mod_proxy_balancerMore runtime configuration changes for BalancerMembers via balancer-managerAdditional BalancerMembers can be added at runtime via balancer-managerRuntime configuration of a subset of Balancer parametersBalancerMembers can be set to 'Drain' so that they only respond to existing sticky sessions, allowing them to be taken gracefully offline.Balancer settings can be persistent after restarts.mod_cacheThe mod_cache CACHE filter can be optionally inserted at a given point in the filter chain to provide fine control over caching.mod_cache can now cache HEAD requests.Where possible, mod_cache directives can now be set per directory, instead of per server.The base URL of cached URLs can be customised, so that a cluster of caches can share the same endpoint URL prefix.mod_cache is now capable of serving stale cached data when a backend is unavailable (error 5xx).mod_cache can now insert HIT/MISS/REVALIDATE into an X-Cache header.mod_includeSupport for the 'onerror' attribute within an 'include' element, allowing an error document to be served on error instead of the default error string.mod_cgi, mod_include, mod_isapi, ...Translation of headers to environment variables is more strict than before to mitigate some possible cross-site-scripting attacks via header injection. Headers containing invalid characters (including underscores) are now silently dropped. Environment Variables in Apache has some pointers on how to work around broken legacy clients which require such headers. (This affects all modules which use these environment variables.)mod_authz_core Authorization Logic ContainersAdvanced authorization logic may now be specified using the Require directive and the related container directives, such as <RequireAll>.mod_rewritemod_rewrite adds the [QSD] (Query String Discard) and [END] flags for RewriteRule to simplify common rewriting scenarios.Adds the possibility to use complex boolean expressions in RewriteCond.Allows the use of SQL queries as RewriteMap functions.mod_ldap, mod_authnz_ldapmod_authnz_ldap adds support for nested groups.mod_ldap adds LDAPConnectionPoolTTL, LDAPTimeout, and other improvements in the handling of timeouts. This is especially useful for setups where a stateful firewall drops idle connections to the LDAP server.mod_ldap adds LDAPLibraryDebug to log debug information provided by the used LDAP toolkit.mod_infomod_info can now dump the pre-parsed configuration to stdout during server startup.mod_auth_basicNew generic mechanism to fake basic authentication (available in 2.4.5 and later).
